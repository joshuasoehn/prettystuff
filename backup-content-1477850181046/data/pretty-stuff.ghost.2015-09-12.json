The first priority is to make sure that your content and images fit the overall style of the site. Also, do not copy posts from other sites or post stuff that has been posted a million times before. Always try to be unique. \n\n##Format\n\nText and images are formatted via the Markdown syntax, making it easy to insert links and images. To read more about the syntax visit http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax. Markdown also gives us the flexibility of using HTML wherever necessary. \n\nLinks that refer to an external website automatically get a target=\"blank\" property, so you don't have to add that manually. \n\nParagraphs should not be too long. Always separate text like this, making it a nice reading experience for the user.\n![](/content/images/2014/Aug/Bildschirmfoto-2014-08-31-um-13-49-56.png)\n\nYou can easily create a grid of two images by wrapping them within a div with the class \"split\" like so:\n\n\t<div class=\"split\">\n\t![](/content/images/2014/Aug/koya-no-sumika-ma-style_9.jpg)\n\t![](/content/images/2014/Aug/koya-no-sumika-ma-style_7.jpg)\n\t</div>\n\t\nOnly use that on two images with the same height in a horizontal format.\n\n![](/content/images/2014/Aug/Bildschirmfoto-2014-08-31-um-13-50-09.png)\n\nThumbnails are automatically generated by taking the first image from the post. So always make sure this image is cropped to the size: __1200px by 800px.__ By using this size we are going to make sure that the posts on the homepage grid always have the same height, which is really important. The thumbnails are scaled down, so they don't get blurry on retina devices. \n\nMake sure to include a button at the end of every post linking to the website/project/person you are writing about, so they always get credit for their work. You can do that easily by using an HTML anchor tag with the class \"button\", like so:\n\n\t<a href=\"yourlink\" class=\"button\">View this on Behance (or something similar)</a>\n\t\n##Social\n\nWe are posting new content on social networks ourselves to make everything more personal. Always try to tag the site/person you are writing about via @company on Facebook and Twitter.\nTry to switch the header image on a regular basis so the profiles don't get boring.

I am very fond of digital design coming from Scandinavia and Kasper’s website is no exception. Type is set in [Patron](http://www.milieugrotesque.com/typefaces/patron/) by Milieu Grotesque and [Apercu Mono](http://www.colophon-foundry.org/fonts/apercu) by the Colophon Type Foundry, which work really well together. \n\n![The type game is strong in this one](/content/images/2015/03/kasper-laigaard-case.png)\n\nThe case pages are wonderful; the big images allow you to really take in the work and the photography is very well done. Presenting cases on devices doesn’t always work that well, but Kasper has nailed it here.\n\n![Kasper's work for ISSUU](/content/images/2015/03/kasper-laigaard-issuu.png)\n![Bang & Olufsen app](/content/images/2015/03/kasper-laigaard-bang-olufsen.png)\n\nOn his portfolio you'll find the work he did for ISSUU, Bang & Olufsen and RVLT. All these projects were done at Hello Monday. A first taste of his personal work can be seen in his – soon to be updated – case for Mumilab, the studio of Peter Ravnsborg, a Danish photographer.  \n\n![Hello Monday's grid-based design](/content/images/2015/03/kasper-laigaard-hello-monday-1.png)\n![Mumilab logotype](/content/images/2015/03/kasper-laigaard-mumilab.png)\n\nTo me, there’s one downside to Kasper’s portfolio. After grabbing my attention with all the great finished work, I want to know more about the process. How did the projects end up the way they did and what were the challenges he/they faced along the way? I’d love some words to accompany the images.\n\nI am excited to see what we’ll see next from Kasper.\n\n<a href=\"http://kasperlaigaard.com/\" class=\"button\">Kasper Laigaard</a>","html":"<p>Kasper Laigaard previously worked at the brilliant Danish digital agency <a href=\"http://hellomonday.com\">Hello Monday</a> as an Art Director/Designer and went freelance a while ago.</p>\n\n<p>To do so, he designed himself a new responsive portfolio website. I am very fond of digital design coming from Scandinavia and Kasper’s website is no exception. Type is set in <a href=\"http://www.milieugrotesque.com/typefaces/patron/\">Patron</a> by Milieu Grotesque and <a href=\"http://www.colophon-foundry.org/fonts/apercu\">Apercu Mono</a> by the Colophon Type Foundry, which work really well together. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2015/03/kasper-laigaard-case.png\" alt=\"The type game is strong in this one\" /></p>\n\n<p>The case pages are wonderful; the big images allow you to really take in the work and the photography is very well done. Presenting cases on devices doesn’t always work that well, but Kasper has nailed it here.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2015/03/kasper-laigaard-issuu.png\" alt=\"Kasper's work for ISSUU\" />\n<img src=\"/content/images/2015/03/kasper-laigaard-bang-olufsen.png\" alt=\"Bang &amp; Olufsen app\" /></p>\n\n<p>On his portfolio you'll find the work he did for ISSUU, Bang &amp; Olufsen and RVLT. All these projects were done at Hello Monday. A first taste of his personal work can be seen in his – soon to be updated – case for Mumilab, the studio of Peter Ravnsborg, a Danish photographer.  </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2015/03/kasper-laigaard-hello-monday-1.png\" alt=\"Hello Monday's grid-based design\" />\n<img src=\"/content/images/2015/03/kasper-laigaard-mumilab.png\" alt=\"Mumilab logotype\" /></p>\n\n<p>To me, there’s one downside to Kasper’s portfolio. After grabbing my attention with all the great finished work, I want to know more about the process. How did the projects end up the way they did and what were the challenges he/they faced along the way? I’d love some words to accompany the images.</p>\n\n<p>I am excited to see what we’ll see next from Kasper.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://kasperlaigaard.com/\" class=\"button\">Kasper Laigaard</a></p>","image":"/content/images/2015/03/kasper-laigaard.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":"Kasper Laigaard (digital design & art direction)","meta_description":"Kasper Laigaard previously worked at the brilliant Danish digital agency Hello Monday as an Art Director and went freelance a while ago.","author_id":2,"created_at":1426415452025,"created_by":2,"updated_at":1426429507491,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1426416988246,"published_by":2},{"id":40,"uuid":"f2292657-6dc4-464f-ada4-5b708e41b83a","title":"Aether Cone","slug":"aether-cone","markdown":"Cone is the first music player that thinks.
